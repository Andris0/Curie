      Classic game of 21 with a modified
      ruleset to allow players to compete with
      each other. Player with the highest card
      value, without going over 21, wins. If
      multiple players have the winning card
      value, amount won is split equally. If
      everyone has the winning value, it is a
      stalemate and players get back the
      amount they have put in. If everyone
      goes over 21, everyone loses, winnings
      go to the void. Value can be a number,
      percentage, keyword 'all' or 'half'. Joining
      players will automatically put the amount
      of Tempests the game was started on.
